# FATDOG
[![Heroku App Status](http://heroku-shields.herokuapp.com/fatdog-cs50)](https://fatdog-cs50.herokuapp.com)

A simple flask application to calculate the daily caloric intake of your dog based on current shape, weight, age, and activity.

## Description

Fatdog was inspired by my quest to cook "real" food, for my dog, Moo. Moo love his homemade chow!

Eventually, I would love to iterate over this idea to include macronutrients, dog profiles, as well as make the algorithm that figures out calories to be more comprehensive and as accurate as possible!
For now, it is a pretty simple application with login, create, read, and destroy functionality.
